The goal of the project was to estimate the probability of success, p, from a Binomial random rasmple and compare different interval procedures that attempt to catpure p. The following methods were used in this project:
* Wald Interval
* Adjusted Wald Interval
* Clopper-Pearson (exact) Interval
* Score Interval
* Raw Percentile Interval using a parametric bootstrap
* Bootstrap t Interval using a parametric bootstrp
